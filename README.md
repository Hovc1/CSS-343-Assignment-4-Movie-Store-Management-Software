# Movie Store Management Software

For the final project for Data Structures, Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics II, I collaborated with one teammate to create a movie store program utilizing object-oriented programming concepts.  

The program inputs data from txt files while filtering out bad inputs.  

It utilizes a Binary Search Tree to store and keep track of different genres of movie objects in its database, and uses a Hash Table to store customer objects also, read from file a txt and assign them unique IDs. 

It uses overloaded operators to compare different movie objects to each other and to sort them based on different sets of properties, like genre.
