# 3x3-Macropad-Project
A small project I did for fun at the start of the lock downs.

It is a 3x3 is a macro pad with a RGB LED that I hand wired with an ARM controller. 
It has 4 layers, and the LED changes color depending on what layer its on.

QMK is an opensource C based framework that lets you program micro controllers. https://docs.qmk.fm/#/
